"QS6CRA1","QS6CRA1CRS1","There may be costs to some organisations for the provision of structured educational programmes. Costs will depend on whether national programmes are purchased or local services are developed.
Costs for structured education programmes, for example, Dose adjustment for normal eating (DAFNE) courses, range from £300 to £350 per patient."
"QS6CRA1","QS6CRA1CRS2","Structured educational programmes might reduce repeat visits for treatment and therefore reduce costs."
"QS6CRA1","QS6CRA1CRS3","Improvement in lifestyle and self-care might reduce admissions to hospital. For example this might lead to a reduction in diabetes-related admissions.
A non-elective diabetes-related admission for hypoglycaemic or hyperglycaemic disorders range from £816 to £3570. 
"
"QS6CRA1","QS6CRA1CRS4","Improved self-management may result in reductions in hospital attendances and admissions. "
"QS6CRA1","QS6CRA1CRS5","Costs associated with psychological assessments and management. Estimated cost for a band 7 post is £43,000 at mid-point of scale."
"QS6CRA1","QS6CRA1CRS6","Provision of assessments tests and management of complications. For example microalbuminuria test costs £8, retinal screening £30 and electrocardiogram test costs £32."
"QS6CRA1","QS6CRA1CRS7","There may be costs locally to improve communication and training of healthcare professionals so that they can provide adequate inpatient services including education and psychological support to people with diabetes prior to discharge.
"
"QS6CRA1","QS6CRA1CRS8","The costing and commissioning implications related to the implementation of care planning depend on the presence or absence of a local care planning 
pathway and culture. Although there would be initial investment in diabetes services, this investment should be offset by savings from reductions in follow-up appointments and reduced use of hospital resources"
"QS6CRA1","QS6CRA1CRS9","There may also be need to train healthcare professionals in personalised care planning, for example. The cost will depend on local circumstances and needs."
"QS6CRA1","QS6CRA1CRS10","Care planning as part of the QIPP long-term conditions work stream can improve patient experience and self-management, leading to a reduction in admissions. By achieving this quality statement commissioners may save on outpatient follow-up attendances to hospitals. The tariff for a single professional follow-up attendance for diabetes medicine is £99 and for multiprofessional follow-up it is £162.
"
"QS6CRA1","QS6CRA1CRS11","A healthcare professional appropriately trained to give nutrition advice is defined in the quality standard as having ‘specific expertise and competencies in nutrition including, but not limited to, a registered dietitian’. Therefore, other members of the multidisciplinary team may have the skills and competencies to deliver personalised nutritional advice and support. Commissioners will need to ensure that local services have processes for monitoring the competencies of the workforce and increasing staff skills in relation to nutrition and physical activity. This needs to reflect the diverse range of professionals
delivering this service component."
"QS6CRA1","QS6CRA1CRS12","NICE technology appraisal 151 recommends that insulin pump therapy be initiated only by a trained specialist team, which should normally comprise a physician with a specialist interest in insulin pump therapy, a diabetes specialist nurse and a dietitian. Commissioners will need to consider how best to provide an efficient model to deliver services, which may include novel ways of working, for example, networks of care across a geographical area.
"
"QS6CRA1","QS6CRA1CRS13"," To achieve quality statement 7, the potential costs involved are £118 for an obstetric first appointment or £297 for a diabetes medicine multidisciplinary appointment."
"QS6CRA1","QS6CRA1CRS14","Investing in annual assessment for the risk and presence of complications may save money by ensuring that any identified complications are treated earlier rather than at an advanced stage of complication. This may require training or retraining of staff so that they can effectively undertake annual assessments in line with NICE guidance.
"
"QS6CRA1","QS6CRA1CRS15","Identifying and managing complications will involve costs, for example a microalbuminuria laboratory test costs £8, retinal screening £30 and electrocardiogram test costs £32. However, the costs will depend on local circumstances and needs"
"QS6CRA1","QS6CRA1CRS16"," the national picture suggests that for many areas there will be resource implications in achieving the standards set out in quality statement 9. the assessment and management of people with psychological conditions 
require a range of multidisciplinary services recommends a stepped-care 
model"
"QS6CRA1","QS6CRA1CRS17","Costs are likely to relate to the provision of training to healthcare professionals so that they can undertake psychological assessments and manage patients in line with recommendations in NICE guidance. In some organisations there might be the need to recruit staff to deliver psychological support. The cost is estimated at £43,000 based on band 7 mid-point of scale for a whole-time equivalent post"
"QS6CRA1","QS6CRA1CRS18","In order to estimate the resource implications of quality statement 10, commissioners may wish to audit their current referral pathway and referral to treatment time for those patients referred with a foot problem who require urgent medical attention. Those involved in the delivery of foot care services should have the necessary competencies, and commissioners should ensure that there is an appropriate process for assessing the competency and skill of the workforce"
"QS6CRA1","QS6CRA1CRS19","Anecdotal evidence suggests foot care and multidisciplinary teams already exist in many areas although there may be variation in the composition of the 
teams. There may be costs involved in referring patients to a multidisciplinary foot care team and providing treatment within 24 hours"
"QS6CRA1","QS6CRA1CRS20","There should be clear protocols to support the timely assessment, management and referral of inpatients who have diabetes emergencies or require diabetes inpatient care for example, self-administration of medication, pre-operative assessment, management of diabetic ketoacidosis and hypoglycaemia, and discharge planning. "
"QS6CRA1","QS6CRA1CRS21","There will be costs involved in ensuring there is 
timely access to specialist diabetes teams for inpatient care especially for 
admissions out of hours"
"QS6CRA1","QS6CRA1CRS22"," There may be costs to improve communication and 
training of healthcare professionals so that they can provide adequate 
inpatient services including education and psychological support to people 
with diabetes prior to discharge. "
"QS6CRA1","QS6CRA1CRS23","Achieving this quality statement may prevent escalation of complications, resulting in shorter lengths of stay inhospital and reduce inpatient healthcare costs associated with diabetes.
