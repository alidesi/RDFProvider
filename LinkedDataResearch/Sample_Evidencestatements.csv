"CG73","","ES1","CG73ES1","","Over the entire GFR range, the studies did not show an important difference in accuracy of estimating kidney function, defined by P30, between MDRD and CKD-EPI. There was, however a trend towards increased accuracy using cystatin C or combined equations. P30 was slightly betterin the subgroup with GFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m2compared to a GFR >60 ml/min/1.73 m2The CKD- EPI creatinine equation was more accurate than the MDRD in people with a GFR >60 ml/min/1.73 m2 Only two studies looked at P30 in cystatin C or combined equations for GFR subgroups.
