","Measuring kidney function 
","1.1","Investigations for CKD","The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is equal to the sum of the filtration rates in all of thefunctioning nephrons and is the best index of overall kidney function. Knowledge of GFR isessential for the diagnosis and management of CKD and is a translatable concept. Because a normal GFR is roughly 100 ml/min/1.73 m2, we can explain kidney function to patients and carers in terms of a percentage of normal – a more easily understandable concept than GFR.  The gold standard methods of estimating GFR require measurement of an ideal filtration marker. These markers should be freely filtered by the glomerulus, should not be bound to plasma proteins, must be excreted unchanged and not be subject to either tubular secretion or absorption. Commonly used markers include inulin, 51Cr-EDTA, 125I-iothalamate and iohexol. Gold standard methods of assessing GFR are technically demanding, expensive, time consuming and unsuitable for widespread identification of CKD in the ‘at risk’ population. 
At the other end of the accuracy scale lies measurement of serum creatinine, which is a universally available endogenous test of kidney function. Although easy and cheap to measure, creatinine is subject to non-renal and analytical influences which make it insufficiently sensitive to detect moderate CKD on its own. Measurement of 24-hour urinary creatinine clearance improves the accuracy but is also subject to the same non-renal and analytical influences compounded by inaccuracies in urine collection, to say nothing of the inconvenience associated with 24-hour urine collections. An alternative and more accurate endogenous marker is cystatin C, a 13 kDa cationic protein produced by all nucleated cells. Serum cystatin C levels are chiefly determined by GFR. Potential limitations of cystatin C as a marker of GFR include lack of assay standardisation, the requirement for a dedicated analytical system, and increased costs relative to serum creatinine (approximately £3/assay compared to <£0.10/assay).
A further alternative is to measure serum creatinine and estimate GFR using an equation which corrects for some of the more significant non-renal influences. This approach is known to be more sensitive for the detection of CKD than serum creatinine and more accurate than creatinine clearance.
So what have previous guideline groups recommended? The SIGN guidelines 32 recommended use of prediction equations in place of 24-hour creatinine clearance or serum creatinine alone and preferred prediction equations to cystatin C on the grounds of practical and resource considerations. The Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation was preferred to the Cockcroft-Gault formula. The UK CKD guidelines and the UK consensus conference recommended use of the 4-variable MDRD equation using zero biased creatinine methods.33,34Others (KDOQI, CARI and KDIGO)14,35–37 have recommended that serum creatinine should not be used alone to assess kidney function, that creatinine assays should be traceable to a = reference creatinine method, and that an estimated GFR should be reported by laboratories
alongside the serum creatinine measurement using the 4-variable MDRD equation. 
","The evidence suggests that in general the 4-variable MDRD performs better than the Cockcroft- Gault equation. However, in older people and in people with GFR greater than 60ml/min/1.73 m2 the MDRD is subject to bias and can underestimate GFR. The GDG noted that serum creatinine is correlated with muscle mass and therefore estimation of GFR using prediction equations in people with extremes of muscle mass is subject to inaccuracy. In those with increased muscle mass GFR will be under estimated and in those withreduced muscle mass GFR will be over estimated. 
Gold standard measures of GFR are time consuming and expensive to perform but where a highly accurate measurement of GFR is required, for example in assessment of kidney donors or for accurate calculation of dosing of potentially toxic chemotherapy, the evidence suggests that GFR estimated from prediction equations is insufficiently accurate. The GDG agreed that significant changes in GFR are equally important in those individuals with GFR greater than 60 ml/min/1.73 m2. Where laboratories do not report levels of GFR greater than 60 ml/min/1.73 m2 the GDG considered that a rise in serum creatinine of greater than 20% should be considered significant.
Although the original MDRD equation included a correction factor for the American black population, there are no correction factors for other populations and in routine use the derived GFR is not corrected for any ethnicity other than African-Caribbean.  Although most laboratories would be capable of measuring cystatin C concentrations there isno evidence to suggest that it was more useful than using the MDRD, with the caveat thatexisting evidence comparing cystatin C and the MDRD failed to appropriately calibrate serumcreatinine measurements to the method of the MDRD laboratory. Cystatin C measurement is also currently more expensive"

","Factors affecting the biological and analytical variability of  GFR estimated from measurement of serum creatinine 
","1.1","Investigation","The measurement of serum creatinine to estimate GFR with predictive equations is subject to biological and analytical variation.  Biological variation includes random variation and predictable cyclical variation (daily, monthly, seasonal). Within-subject biological variation is the average random fluctuation around a homeostatic set point, expressed mathematically as a coefficient of variation (CV).55 Large variations in serum creatinine measurements could result in misclassification of people to a particular CKD stage. Factors affecting measured serum creatinine concentration and estimated GFR from prediction equations include ingestion of cooked meat (where the cooking process converts meat creatine to creatinine, which is subsequently absorbed into the bloodstream after ingestion), individual patient fluid status, diurnal variation, and centrifugation of blood samples. 
Plasma creatinine measurements also vary depending on the method/analyser used and there is inter-laboratory variation which changes with creatinine concentration. There is no (single) standard method used across England. Method precision at higher levels of creatinine has less variability and thus has marginal impact on the interpretation of eGFR from prediction equations. However, in the critical diagnostic range there is concern that inter-method/laboratory variation may impact on the diagnostic utility of eGFR. This is probably at creatinine concentrations of less than 180 µmol/l. If creatinine levels are overestimated because of method bias/variability this will result in a reduced eGFR (false positives) and misclassification of CKD. This will lead to increased referral rates and inappropriate labelling of patients as having CKD. If
creatinine levels are underestimated, the reverse will happen (false negatives). 
Since April 2006, creatinine assays in chemistry laboratories in England have been calibrated to the gold standard reference method of isotope dilution mass spectrophotometry (IDMS) through the National External Quality Assurance Scheme. This has enabled reporting of an IDMS-related MDRD derived eGFR to minimise interlaboratory variation in GFR results. This section addresses other sources of bias and variation in creatinine measurement.","The GDG noted that although the biochemical assay for creatinine is precise, a number of factors affect serum creatinine levels, particularly the person’s state of hydration and whether they had recently eaten meat. Serum creatinine concentrations also show diurnal variation. This means that
the eGFR derived using the 4-variable MDRD equation will also be affected by these factors.
When making a diagnosis of CKD, assessing the stage of CKD, or monitoring patients for evidence of declining kidney function, it is important that clinicians are aware of the factors that can influence creatinine concentrations. It was recommended that whenever possible they take steps to minimise the biases that these factors introduce and that they are aware that changes of less than 5% may simply be due to biological and analytical variability. Whilst a simple solution to the variability introduced by eating meat would be to recommend an overnight fast before having a blood sample taken, it was agreed that this was unnecessarily restrictive."

","Detection of blood and protein in the urine","1.1","Investigation","The persistent presence of protein (proteinuria), albumin (albuminuria), or red blood cells (haematuria) in urine is evidence of kidney damage. Diagnostic tests that can rapidly detect the presence of protein or red blood cells in urine with high specificity and sensitivity are integral to the early detection and management of CKD.  Haematuria is defined as the presence of red blood cells (RBCs) in the urine, either visible
(macroscopic haematuria) or invisible and detected by direct microscopy (microscopic haematuria). A reagent strip test to detect blood in urine provides an instant result and is often the method of detection of invisible haematuria in the primary care setting.67 The reagent strip or ‘dipstick’ test is commonly considered to be sensitive for the detection of RBCs below the defined (microscopic) 3 RBCs per high power field threshold for invisible haematuria. Dipstick testing of spot urine samples is also used for rapid detection of protein and albumin. However, reagent strips are subject to false positives because of patient dehydration, exercise, infection, and extremely alkaline urine. False negative results occur as a result of excessive hydration and urine proteins other than albumin. 
Haematuria can be broadly classified as nephrological or urological in origin. Most forms of intrinsic kidney disease may result in invisible haematuria. Urological causes include tumours, urinary tract infection, stone disease and bleeding from benign conditions of the urinary tract. Invisible haematuria may also be detected in the absence of any underlying pathology, such as after vigorous exercise.68 The prevalence of asymptomatic invisible haematuria varies between 0.19% and 21%, depending on age and gender. Screening studies have suggested that the prevalence of asymptomatic invisible haematuria in the UK adult male population is around 2.5%, increasing to 22% in men over the age of 60 years.69,70","It was noted that reagent strips have been used to identify and quantify the presence of albumin, total protein and red blood cells in a urine sample. Some reagent strips identify the presence of
both haematuria and proteinuria. There was no evidence to suggest one type of reagent strip performed better than the others. It was noted that the reagent strips used to detect proteinuria in routine clinical practice are predominantly sensitive to albumin not to total protein. When considering the evidence concerning haematuria the GDG were aware that in many circumstances haematuria is a feature of urological disease rather than CKD.
Unless performed using phase contrast microscopy on a sample that has been received promptly, laboratory assessment of haematuria is less accurate than reagent strip testing because of cell lysis during transport to the laboratory and inaccuracies in quantifying the red blood cells present. There is no consensus about whether a ‘trace’ or one ‘+’ should be considered positive when testing for haematuria using reagent strips. The GDG recommended that the presence of one ‘+’ should be considered positive.
When considering nephrological causes of haematuria it was noted that most clinicians would need evidence of concurrent proteinuria (ACR >30 mg/mmol) and/or evidence of deterioration in GFR before recommending renal biopsy. 
When considering the use of reagent strips to identify or quantify proteinuria it was again noted that although 24-hour urine collections for urinary protein estimation have been considered to
be the ‘gold standard’ they are subject to inaccuracies due to incomplete collection of all urine voided or inaccurate timing, and the biochemical methods used to quantify the amount of
protein present give different results. There is no evidence about the frequency with which testing for proteinuria should subsequently
be repeated. 
It was noted that the timing of the urine sample was important to get a meaningful result. A morning sample is best as the urine is most concentrated and thus the concentration of protein will be highest and more likely to be detected. It was recognised, however, that stipulating that testing should only be undertaken on morning samples would cause practical difficulties for service organisation and might inhibit opportunistic testing.
The GDG noted that use of reagent strip tests for identification of significant proteinuria was dependent on urine concentration, rendering them unreliable for both detection of small
amounts of proteinuria and for accurately quantifying the degree of proteinuria.  ACR is the test of choice to identify proteinuria in people with diabetes and is already widely used in practice. Albumin is the predominant component of proteinuria in glomerular disease, however the non-diabetic CKD literature reviewed in this guideline is based on 24-hour urinary protein excretion. 
It is this guideline’s purpose to improve early identification and help prevent progression of CKD. Epidemiological study increasingly underlines the importance of even a low level of
proteinuria as a strong predictor of adverse outcome. Reagent strips in current clinical practice predominantly detect albumin, not total protein, but are not reliably quantitative. Studies to inform intervention levels of ACR in non-diabetic CKD are not yet available and it is not possible to derive a simple correction factor that allows the precise conversion of ACR values to PCR. However, ACR has far greater sensitivity than PCR for the detection of low levels of proteinuria and thus lends itself to detection and identification of CKD.
When the clinical and cost-effectiveness evidence is all taken into account, considerable uncertainty remains about the choice of ACR or PCR. Clinical opinion was divided among stakeholder organisations and within the GDG, but given the considerations above, the GDG made a consensus recommendation that ACR should be the test of choice to identify proteinuria and possible chronic kidney disease. The GDG however also noted that there will often be good clinical reasons for subsequently using PCR to quantify and monitor significant levels of proteinuria.
The GDG noted that an ACR of ≥30 mg/mmol, or PCR ≥50 mg/mmol in association with haematuria or an ACR ≥70 mg/mmol, or PCR ≥100 mg/mmol in the absence of haematuria were considered indications for referral to nephrology (see section 6.1.4). It was agreed that the finding of levels of ACR <70 mg/mmol, or PCR <100 mg/mmol should be confirmed using an early morning urine sample.

","Urinary albumin:creatinine and protein:creatinine ratios,  and their relationship to 24-hour urinary protein","1.1","Investigation","Proteinuria is a cardinal sign of kidney disease. Measurement of total protein in urine is a traditional, inexpensive and well established test for kidney injury. A vast body of nephrological literature is predicated on 24-hour urinary total protein. Significant proteinuria is an independent risk factor for both progression of CKD and cardiovascular disease. Monitoring of urinary proteinuria is both part of the routine evaluation of those at risk of CKD and is an important method of assessing progression and response to therapy.  Proteins normally excreted in the urine include albumin, low molecular weight immunoglobulin (filtered plasma proteins), and secreted tubular proteins. There is no consistent definition of proteinuria. The upper limit of normal is approximately 150 mg/24 h, equivalent to a protein:creatinine ratio (PCR) of 15 mg/mmol (given an average daily urine creatinine excretion of 10 mmol), but the cut off for abnormal varies from laboratory to laboratory. By contrast, urinary albumin measurement provides a quantitative, relatively standardised measurement of excretion of the single most important protein in most nephropathies. The normal mean value for urine albumin is 10 mg/day, microalbuminuria is defined as 30–300 mg/day or an albumin:creatinine ratio (ACR) of >2.5 mg/mmol in men and >3.5 mg/mmol in women. Macroalbuminuria is a urinary albumin greater than 300 mg/day (ACR >30 mg/mmol).","Although 24-hour urine collections for protein and albumin are often used in diagnostic
studies as the ‘gold standard’, 24-hour collections are subject to inaccuracies due to incomplete
collection of all urine voided or inaccurate timing and the biochemical methods used to
quantify the amount of protein present will give different results. Further, the objective of these
tests in clinical practice is to detect people with CKD at increased risk of progression, and it is
not yet established whether either one of proteinuria or albuminuria is superior to the other in
this regard.
The evidence reviewed for the measurement of protein, albumin, PCR and ACR came from
different disease groups, and in some cases different ethnic groups. The GDG noted that the
influence of either disease or ethnicity on actual measurement was questionable.
ACR and PCR overcome inaccuracies related to timing of collection and incomplete urine
collection but measure different proteins.
For the identification of proteinuria in routine clinical practise a single test has been
recommended.
The amount of albuminuria was considered the most relevant measurement and has the
advantage that the amount of albumin can be accurately measured if an immunologic assay is
used.
The cost-effectiveness analysis (Appendix C) showed that ACR (performed in a hospital laboratory) was more cost-effective than the use of protein or albumin reagent strips. In a sensitivity analysis, we found that ACR has to be only very slightly more accurate than PCR for ACR to be cost-effective across a range of plausible cost differentials. It is not possible to derive a simple correction factor that allows the conversion of ACR values to PCR or 24-hour urinary protein excretion rates because the relative amounts of albumin and other proteins will vary depending on the clinical circumstances; however, the GDG produced a table of approximate equivalents that will allow clinicians unfamiliar with ACR values to see the approximate equivalent PCR and 24-hour urinary protein excretion rates (Table 4.5)."
"CG73","","S6","CG73S6","","Classification and early identification","The influence of GFR, age, gender, ethnicity and  proteinuria on patient outcomes","1.2","Classification","If we cannot prevent CKD then we want to minimise the associated adverse outcomes. To do this we need to know:
● what the adverse outcomes are
● at what level of GFR we should be alert to adverse outcomes and
● the impact of associated factors such as age, gender and presence or absence of
proteinuria at any given level of GFR. 
Large population studies have clearly suggested that the risk of death, hospitalisation and cardiovascular events rises exponentially at levels of GFR below 60 ml/min/1.73 m2.13 Other complications associated with reduced GFR, such as the increased potential for dose-relateddrug toxicity, are less obvious but equally important. 
The National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (NKF-KDOQI) stratified chronic kidney disease into five stages according to glomerular filtration rate and the
presence of kidney damage:
● Stage 1: GFR >90 ml/min/1.73 m2with other evidence of kidney damage (persistent microalbuminuria, persistent proteinuria, persistent haematuria, structural abnormalities of the kidneys demonstrated on ultrasound scanning or other radiological tests, or biopsy-proven chronic glomerulonephritis)
● Stage 2: GFR 60–89 ml/min/1.73 m2 with other evidence of kidney damage
● Stage 3: GFR 30–59 ml/min/1.73 m2
● Stage 4: GFR 15–29 ml/min/1.73 m2
● Stage 5: GFR <15 ml/min/1.73 m2","There has been debate about the implications of having a reduced GFR and, in particular, whether a stable GFR that does not change over time is associated with adverse health outcomes. Not all studies stratified patients according to whether or not they had diabetes and this may affect estimates of the risk of death. The evidence suggested that if the GFR is less than 60 ml/min/1.73 m2, then there is an
increased risk of mortality which is seen in all age groups.  There was limited evidence about outcomes in older people. However, given that they are at increased absolute risk of mortality and cardiovascular events it was agreed that even small increases in relative risk in older people are of significance. The GDG considered that the evidence suggested that the risk of mortality and cardiovascular events increased considerably when the GFR was less than 45 ml/min/1.73 m2. This led to the proposal to adopt the sub-division of stage 3 CKD into stages 3A and 3B, defined by an eGFR 45–59 ml/min/1.73 m2 and 30–44 ml/min/1.73m2 respectively.

"CG73","","S7","CG73S7","","Classification and early identification","Who should be tested for CKD?","1.2","Classification","The early identification and treatment of CKD is essential to decrease the risk of cardiovascular disease, progression to ESRD, and mortality. Identification of high-risk groups can help clinicians
monitor renal function and identify people with CKD at an earlier disease stage. Although general population screening may not be cost-effective, targeted screening directed at subgroups of the population who might derive the most benefit from CKD detection was shown to be an effective strategy.138 A national programme to identify vulnerability to vascular diseases was announced by the Health Secretary in April 2008, following initial results from modelling work carried out by the Department of Health. This work suggested that a vascular check programme would prevent 4000 people a year from developing diabetes and could also detect at least 25,000 cases of diabetes or kidney disease earlier. In those conditions where the prevalence of CKD is high and the risks of preventable complications are increased, testing for CKD is clearly warranted. The KEEP programme identified people with diabetes and hypertension, or people with a first-line relative (parent, grandparent, brother or sister) with diabetes, high blood pressure or kidney
disease as being at high risk of CKD. Are there additional high-risk people who should be tested for CKD? The UK CKD guidelines also included those with a high risk of obstructive uropathy,
all forms of CVD, multisystem diseases with the potential to involve the kidney such as SLE, and conditions requiring long-term treatment with potentially nephrotoxic drugs.33 In addressing this question all of these factors were considered, together with other lifestyle factors such as smoking, obesity and alcohol intake.The 2014 GDG voted that recommendation 31 shoud be a key priority for implementation as the 
recommendation was likely to have a high impact on outcomes that are important to patients and include actions that are measurable. They felt that this recommendation could be a key target for  primary care and could be collected within CKD National Audit.","When considering this evidence the GDG was particularly concerned with facilitating the early identification of people with CKD so that they may benefit from treatment to prevent worsening kidney function.
The GDG considered that multisystem diseases with the potential to involve the kidney, such as SLE, were clearly risk factors for CKD. The evidence principally assessed demographic and behavioural risk factors for CKD but in addition it was recognised that diabetes and cardiovascular disease, particularly ischaemic heart disease, chronic heart failure, peripheral vascular disease and cerebrovascular disease are all risk
factors for CKD. The GDG noted that the increased prevalence of CKD seen in the NHANES studies (1988–1994 compared with 1999–2004) was associated with an increased prevalence of diagnosed diabetes and hypertension. There was uncertainly regarding the significance of a family history of CKD but the GDG recommended that people with a family history of stage 5 CKD or hereditary kidney disease
should be considered at risk of having CKD. GDG consensus was that those with structural renal tract disease, multiple and recurrent renal calculi and urinary outflow tract obstruction should be considered at risk of having CKD. The GDG also recommended that people found incidentally to have haematuria or proteinuria on opportunistic medical testing should be considered at risk of having CKD.
The cost-effectiveness evidence suggests that testing for CKD in high-risk groups (such as those with hypertension or diabetes) is highly cost-effective. However, for over 55s without additional risk factors, the prevalence of CKD with proteinuria was too low for testing to be cost-effective. Although specific evidence for drug-induced nephrotoxicity was not considered, the GDG noted that both acute and chronic use of drugs known to be potentially nephrotoxic can lead to CKD. The use of certain agents such as lithium and calcineurin inhibitors should be monitored and the GDG considered that long-term chronic use of NSAIDs should prompt an annual GFR check. Further information can be obtained in the BNF. The GDG did not consider the evidence about smoking, alcohol intake, abnormal lipids, obesity (in the absence of metabolic syndrome), lower socioeconomic status and ethnicity strong enough to recommend that people in these groups should be tested for CKD."
"CG73","","S8","CG73S8","","Classification and early identification","Acute kidney injury, diabetes, glomerular disease and hypertension as risk factors for CKD 
","","Classification","The 2 major causes of CKD are diabetes and hypertension and the prevalence of CKD in the population rises with age. In many people with CKD the cause is uncertain and both diabetes and/or hypertension may co-exist with CKD together with the primary cause. There is a complex relationship between hypertension and kidney disease, hypertension may develop as a complication of CKD accelerate progression. In UK renal registry data123 13 diabetes remains the biggest documented cause of end stage kidney failure (Table 29). 
","The GDG agreed that progression of CKD (measured by change in eGFR and occurrence of end stage renal disease), mortality (all-cause and cardiovascular) and cardiovascular events were critical to decision making. Hospitalisation was also considered as important. However, no information was available for cardiovascular events or hospitalisation. 
There was evidence from an IPD meta-analysis that people with CKD and diabetes are at increased risk of mortality compared to those without diabetes irrespective of eGFR. The effect on progression of CKD was suggestive of an increased risk in people with diabetes, but the association was less clear.

"CG73","","S9","CG73S9","","Defining progression of CKD and the risk factors associated with progression","Defining progression","1.5","Progression","The Renal NSF adopted the US National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (NKF-KDOQI) classification of CKD.35 Whilst the beauty of this classification is its simplicity, this is also its weakness. The clinical features and course of CKD are dependent on a number of factors including the underlying cause, severity and associated conditions of the underlying cause.
Although the classification of CKD into 5 stages has been widely adopted, it has been criticised as not being sufficiently sophisticated for clinical needs. The existing classification is neither staged according to age, nor according to level of proteinuria. All patients, regardless of age, gender and proteinuria/albuminuria are considered to have at least moderately severe CKD when their GFR is <60 ml/min/1.73 m2. This guideline recommends that stage 3 should be subdivided into 3A and 3B, and that the suffix ‘(p)’ in parenthesis be adopted in the different stages to underline the importance of proteinuria/albuminuria as an independent risk factor for adverse outcomes (Table 6.1).
A further criticism of the existing classification of CKD has been the suggestion that loss of GFR is a feature of ageing and that many people classified as stage 3 CKD are merely exhibiting a normal ageing process. The effects of normal ageing on renal function are controversial. Data from some studies suggest that the decline in GFR with increasing age may be largely attributable to comorbidities such as hypertension and heart failure. Loss of renal function may not, therefore, be an inevitable consequence of ageing.158–160 This was supported by studies demonstrating no or very little decline in GFR in the older population with longitudinal follow-up. The focus of defining progression of CKD in this section was to consider what constitutes progression in terms of rate of decline of GFR in order to provide clear guidance to clinicians. However, controversy over what constitutes normality in the group with the highest prevalence of CKD makes defining what constitutes progression even more difficult. Consideration must also be given to the inherent biological and analytical variation associated with estimation of GFR from serum creatinine measurements.","The GDG agreed that the evidence regarding the relationship between adverse outcomes and levels of GFR should be used as the basis of defining CKD but noted that the management and prognosis in people with a reduced but stable GFR may be quite different to that in people with a progressive decline in GFR. Hence the consideration of the evidence centered on a review of whether there is a decline in GFR and whether the decline was always the result of kidney disease or whether there was a ‘natural’ decline as a function of ageing and if so what level of decline should be considered normal.
The longitudinal studies contained mixed populations in that not all participants were followed up for the full duration of the study.
The lower kidney function described in one study of older people may be due to unrecognised kidney disease. However, there appears to be a small ‘natural’ age related decline in kidney function. Nevertheless it was recommended that the interpretation of GFR measurements should not normally be affected by the age of the person and that a low value should prompt the same response regardless of age.
The GDG agreed that a decline in GFR of more than 2 ml/min/1.73 m2 per year was more than could be accounted for by ageing alone.
The GDG recommended that, when interpreting the rate of decline of eGFR, it was also necessary to consider the baseline level of kidney function and the likelihood that kidney function would reach a level where renal replacement therapy would be needed if the rate of decline was maintained. For example, a rate of decline of 3 ml/min/1.73 m2 per year would be of greater concern in a person with a baseline eGFR of 30 ml/min/1.73 m2 aged 40 than in a person aged 70 with a baseline eGFR of 60 ml/min/1.73 m2.
When assessing the rate of decline in eGFR, the GDG agreed that a minimum of 3 measurements in not less than 90 days was required (depending on the initial level of eGFR). If a large and unexplained fall in GFR was observed, more frequent monitoring would be needed. Changes in GFR must be interpreted in light of the evidence on biological and assay variability in serum creatinine measurements, which is estimated at 5%. A calculation based on this would suggest that a decline in eGFR of 10 ml/min/1.73m2 per year would carry a 95% probability of significance. However, given that a decline in eGFR of more than 2 ml/min/1.73 m2 per year was more than could be accounted for by ageing alone the GDG agreed to define progression as either a decline in eGFR of >5 ml/min/1.73m2 within 1 year or a decline of >10 ml/min/1.73m2 within 5 years.
There was evidence from an IPD meta-analysis that people with CKD and diabetes are at increased risk of mortality compared to those without diabetes irrespective of eGFR. The effect on progression of CKD was suggestive of an increased risk in people with diabetes, but the association was less clear. 
The only available evidence for glomerular disease compared progression in different histological types of primary glomerulonephritis. Evidence suggested that membranous nephropathy, IgA nephropathy and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and membranoproliferative glomerulosclerosis were all associated with a sequentially increased risk of end stage renal disease or dialysis than minimal change disease (membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis carried the greatest risk). Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis was associated with a greater risk of end stage renal disease than IgA nephropathy. However, the increased risk of all-cause mortality was only greater in membranous nephropathy, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis. The GDG agreed a recommendation could not be based on this evidence alone, although it did suggest that type of glomerular disease could influence CKD progression. The objective of this review was to determine whether adverse outcomes are 
different in people with CKD and AKI (or history of AKI) compared to those without AKI. However, there was overlap with another question to determine whether an episode of AKI affects progression of CKD. The evidence reviewed included a mixture of comparisons. One compared two types of AKI, CKD and a control group,12 one compared people with CKD to different stages of AKI313
 and another compared people with and without prior CKD with or without AKI.425 The study which most directly met the review question, did not present sufficient data for analyses.207
However, the included studies did indicate that AKI increases risk of CKD progression, at all levels of eGFR. The GDG discussed that current practice was to treat people who recover from AKI as normal and not at increased risk of CKD, but evidence from this review suggests that this is not the case. In light of this evidence the GDG agreed that recommendation R25 from CG73 should include AKI in the list of risk factors that indicate testing for CKD be considered when the other AKI review was considered. The GDG also agreed that it was important to draft a recommendation to highlight 
that cause of CKD should be investigated following diagnosis. This was particularly important with a view to identifying possible treatable causes of CKD.

Whilst it is clear that CKD is common, and recently published studies suggest that its prevalence is increasing,22 it is also clear that many people with diagnosed CKD do not progress.11,12 Importantly, their risk of cardiovascular disease is massively increased compared to the general population. In those that do progress, the subsequent mortality and morbidity risks rise exponentially, as do the associated healthcare costs. A reduced GFR is also associated with a wide range of complications such as hypertension, anaemia, renal bone disease, malnutrition, neuropathy and reduced quality of life. It is therefore important to clarify exactly what factors are associated with CKD progression, and which are remediable or potentially modifiable, in order to intervene at the earliest possible stage and improve the associated adverse outcomes.

","The GDG accepted that there was extensive clinical evidence that hypertension, diabetes and the presence of proteinuria are well recognised risk factors for progression of CKD.
The GDG also accepted that nephrotoxic drugs may affect progression. Of particular concern are the possible acute and chronic effects of NSAIDs which are available without prescription. Acute use of NSAIDs can lead to an acute and usually reversible fall in GFR but chronic use at therapeutic doses could be associated with progression of CKD. The GDG considered that the Murray et al. study examining the effects of chronic use of NSAIDs had follow-up too short to allow meaningful conclusions to be drawn. It was recommended that if chronic use of NSAIDs was considered clinically necessary the effect on GFR should be monitored and the drugs should be stopped if there is evidence of progressive CKD.
The evidence about possible adverse effects of aspirin was felt to be confounded by the use of aspirin in patients with cardiovascular disease which is a known risk factor for progression of CKD.
The evidence on the effects of smoking and ethnicity on the risk of progression was not conclusive but was sufficiently suggestive to merit highlighting within a recommendation.
The evidence on the effects of obesity on the risk of progression was unconvincing and did not require highlighting within a recommendation.
Despite the lack of evidence for urinary outflow tract obstruction for progression of CKD, the GDG consensus was that obstruction to outflow would lead to progression of CKD. Therefore it was agreed that urinary outflow tract obstruction should be considered as a risk factor.

","Alterations in the control mechanisms for calcium and phosphate homeostasis occur early in the course of CKD and progress as kidney function decreases. Changes that occur include abnormalities of calcium, phosphate, parathyroid hormone (PTH), and vitamin D metabolism; together with abnormalities of bone turnover, mineralisation, volume, linear growth, and strength; plus vascular or soft tissue calcification.245 A wide variety of disturbances of bone metabolism may occur in the setting of CKD necessitating an understanding of the changes that occur in order to design a  treatment strategy. However, an in-depthdiscussion of metabolic bone disease in CKD is beyond the  scope of this guideline. This section is focussed on the changes that occur early in the course of CKD. The aim is to prevent metabolic bone disease by maintaining the blood levels of calcium and phosphate as close to normal as possible, and preventing the development of established  hyperparathyroidism and parathyroid hyperplasia. Central to the prevention of these disturbances is an ability to intervene early, recognising that bone disease in people with kidney disease is often asymptomatic, and symptoms appear only late in its course, long after the gold standard for assessment of metabolic bone disease it is neither widely available nor widely used. Biochemical assessment is the mainstay of diagnosis and treatment. In addition to  measurements of calcium and phosphate it is essential to obtain a direct index of parathyroid activity  by measurement of PTH. Under certain circumstances measurement of vitamin D may also be necessary. When should these parameters be measured and at what frequency should they be  repeated?","The GDG noted that in many of the studies the results were not broken down by stage of CKD or level of GFR. Although there were statistically significant differences in mean calcium concentrations at different levels of GFR these were unlikely to be clinically significant differences. On the basis of the evidence the GDG agreed that there was no need to routinely measure serum calcium concentrations in  people with stage 1, 2 and 3A CKD and that it was not usually necessary to measure it in people with  stage 3B CKD. The GDG noted that although there were statistically significant differences in mean phosphateconcentrations at different levels of GFR these values were all within the normal range. Serum phosphate concentrations generally fell within the normal range unless the GFR level was below 20 ml/min/1.73 m2. 12 On the basis of the evidence the GDG agreed that there was no need to routinely measure serum phosphate concentrations in people with stage 1, 2 and 3A CKD and that it was not usually necessary to measure it in people with stage 3B CKD.  The prevalence of hyperparathyroidism in people with a reduced GFR was higher than in healthy  individuals; however, the significance of modestly elevated PTH concentrations was thought unclear and there was no consensus on whether people with concentrations elevated to this extent benefit from treatment. On the basis of the evidence the GDG agreed that there was no requirement to routinely measure serum PTH concentrations in people with stage 1, 2 and 3A CKD and that it was not usually necessary to measure it in people with stage 3B CKD in absence of specific indications. 
Specific indications to measure serum PTH would include unexplained hypercalcaemia and symptoms suggestive of hyperparathyroidism. 
Most laboratories do not measure 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D concentrations. On the basis of the evidence the GDG agreed that there was no need to routinely measure serum vitamin D concentrations in people with stage 1, 2 and 3A CKD and that it was not usually necessary to measure it in people with stage 3B CKD except where there are specific indications such as unexplained hypocalcaemia or symptoms suggestive of vitamin D deficiency.  Because of the increased prevalence of abnormal serum calcium, phosphate, PTH and vitamin D concentrations in people with stage 4 and 5 CKD and the fact that these people may require 
treatment for renal bone disease it was recommended that calcium, phosphate and PTH concentrations should be measured in people with stage 4 and 5 CKD. There was no evidence to guide a recommendation about how frequently the calcium, phosphate, PTH and vitamin D concentrations should be measured in people with stage 4 and 5 CKD and the GDG agreed that this would be determined by the clinical circumstances.

"CG73","","S12","CG73S12","","Other complications of chronic kidney disease","Risks and benefits of bisphosphonates for preventing osteoporosis in adults with CKD ","","Bone Metabolism and Osteoporosis ","Osteoporosis is caused by the cumulative effect of bone resorption in excess of bone formation.  Bisphosphonates inhibit bone resorption with relatively few side effects and are widely used for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. Osteoporosis can also develop in people with CKD and ESRD for many reasons beyond age-related bone loss and postmenopausal bone loss. People with CKD are far more likely than the general population to have conditions putting them at risk of osteoporosis and are much more likely to be prescribed medication promoting development of osteoporosis. The diagnosis of osteoporosis in people with advanced CKD is not as straightforward as it is in people with postmenopausal osteoporosis. Neither fragility fractures nor the World Health Organization bone mineral density criteria can be used to diagnose osteoporosis in this population since all forms of renal bone disease may fracture or have low ‘T scores’. The diagnosis of osteoporosis in people with CKD must be done by first excluding the other forms of renal osteodystrophy.256 33 Bisphosphonates are poorly absorbed orally (1–5% of an oral dose), and absorption is best when the drug is given on an empty stomach. Approximately 80% of the absorbed bisphosphonate is usually cleared by the kidney, the remaining 20% being taken up by bone. Relative bone uptake is increased in conditions of high bone turnover, with less of the drug being excreted by the kidneys. The plasma half-life is approximately one hour, while the bisphosphonate may persist in bone for the lifetime of the patient. ","The GDG concluded that from the studies presented there was no evidence of an increased risk of drug related adverse events in people with CKD. Bisphosphonates appeared to have benefits on bone mineral density in people with CKD. The studies did not include people with a GFR <30 ml/min/1.73 m2and therefore there is no evidence about either the effectiveness or the safety of bisphosphonates in this group. Guidelines on the management of osteoporosis do not make recommendations that relate to people with CKD. The dose of bisphosphonate may need adjusting according to the GFR and clinicians should refer to  the drugs’ Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) for guidance on this.
