"Title","Observation"
"Standard rec numbering","Rec numbering differs between full and NICE guideline - which to use? Should look to adopt/publish as external standard"
"Recs","Differences between full guideline and NICE guideline where NICE have moved the original recommendations around to different sections ( presumably because they think they fit better). Recs 18 - 26 in full guideline become recs 1.4.1, 1.4.2, 1.2.1, 1.2.2, 1.2.3, 1.2.4, 1.2.21, 1.2.22, 1.2.23"
"","Very complicated to sort old from updated:-("
"Evidence statements","Evidence statements from the call for evidence?? Not included"
"Updating","All update info seems to be included in new version but hard to draw out. New version likely to be combo of new evidence statements alongside old ones, new recommendations, changed wording to recommendations and recommendations withdrawn/superceded or NICE rec numbers changed ( less important moving forward). Also new studies included."
